      "value": "<p>Your experience working with monster parts and salvaged equipment makes you adept enough to create weapons and armor directly from your trophies. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.kajI2r9RmtW5xYL7]{Monster Crafting} skill feat even if you don't qualify for its prerequisites, and when you use it you can consume an unused trophy in addition to the body of a monster, incorporating the trophy into the item's construction. If you later designate the item as a hunting tool (for example, a bloodseeking blade or warded mail signature tool), you gain its reinforced benefits as if you had reinforced it with the consumed trophy. You can still reinforce the item normally with another trophy, and you can switch which trophy's characteristics it uses as a 1-minute activity with the manipulate trait.</p>",
