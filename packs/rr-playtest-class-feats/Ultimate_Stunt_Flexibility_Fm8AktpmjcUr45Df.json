      "value": "<p>Your experience allows you to change your strategies to meet any situation. When you gain a daredevil feat using combat flexibility, you gain three daredevil feats instead of two. While the first feat must still be 8th level or lower, the second feat can be up to 14th level, and the third feat can be up to 18th level.</p><p>You can use the first feat to meet the prerequisites of the second or third feats and the second feat to meet the prerequisites of the third feat. You must meet all three feats' other prerequisites normally, and they must all have the press trait.</p><p>In addition, you can adapt to the challenges of adventuring by spending 1 hour to train. If you do, you can reselect the feats chosen with combat flexibility as if you had made your daily preparations. You can't trade out limited-use abilities that you've already used, such as @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-playtest-data.rr-playtest-class-feats.Item.UhvvPxTVhkHC0JSs]{Fortify Self}.</p>",
