After you finish gathering details, the GM tells you whether or not the creature's level is equal to or higher than yours. If it is, you can mark that creature as your quarry, preparing your tools to hunt it.</p><p>You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Survival checks when you [[/act track options=target:mark:quarry]] your quarry and to Monster Lore checks to [[/act recall-knowledge skill=monster-lore options=target:mark:quarry]] about your quarry. You also gain additional benefits based on your slayer's arsenal. You can have only one creature designated as your quarry at a time, and the designation lasts until you use Mark Quarry again or until your level exceeds your quarry's. If you already had a creature designated as your quarry when you used Mark Quarry, the first creature can't be your quarry again for 24 hours.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e-playtest-data.rr-playtest-effects.Item.tAFw2ybe6aI9Sxe2]{Effect: Mark Quarry}</p>",
