Invocation requires you to be able to speak clearly in a strong voice and requires that you be within 30 feet of the target rune or runes unless another ability changes this. The target rune then fades away immediately after the action resolves.",

You can use any action with the relentless trait with the extra action you get from On the Hunt (in addition to one or more of your normal actions, in the case of 2– or 3–action activities with the relentless trait).",
            "Risky": "Actions with this trait grant you adrenaline until the beginning of your next turn. You gain adrenaline at the start of the risky action (before you move or attempt any rolls) and you retain your adrenaline even if an attack or skill check associated with the risky action fails.",
            "Rune": "A runesmith doesn't cast spells, but they can apply various magical effects through runes. Runes can be applied via <strong>etching</strong> or <strong>tracing</strong>. Etched runes are applied in exploration mode and last indefinitely, while traced runes last only until the end of your next turn. Their effects, however, are the same. Several abilities refer to creatures bearing one of your runes, known as rune-bearers—this is any creature who has one of your runes applied to its body or to any gear it is holding.",
            "Thrall": "Thralls are undead creatures, but they are not minions with the summoned trait. They can't take actions, but they can be used for various abilities. Unless noted otherwise, a thrall is Small or Medium (chosen by you when you create it) and must be created in an unoccupied space. A thrall can contribute to flanking as though it were able to make melee unarmed Strikes. A thrall has 1 Hit Point, is automatically hit by attacks, and automatically fails all saving throws. A thrall is immune to bleed, death effects, disease, mental, and poison. A thrall is level −1 if an effect needs to refer to its level. Spells or abilities that create thralls have the thrall trait."
