      "value": "<p>When you smash your enemy into the scenery, it does real damage. Whenever you have adrenaline and force a target to move, and the movement is interrupted by a prop (see below), the target takes an amount of bludgeoning damage equal 1d6 plus your Strength modifier (@Damage[(ceil(@actor.level/4)d6+@actor.system.abilities.str.mod)[bludgeoning]]). This damage increases by 1d6 at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level.</p><hr /><p><strong>Prop:</strong> A prop can be anything large and sturdy enough for you to push yourself off of. This includes a creature that is larger than you or a wall, column, or other durable terrain feature. The GM decides whether a creature or object counts as a prop, depending on the circumstances. For instance, the GM might decide that you can't use a Huge ooze as a prop, due to the consistency of its protoplasm.</p>",
