You can use @UUID[Compendium.pf2e-playtest-data.rr-playtest-class-feats.Item.MW9pnWb4SPbdJIt0]{Breakaway Attack} as a 2-action activity to Interact to pick up an object and make a ranged Strike. Then, as the item ricochets off your first target, you can then make a second ranged Strike at the same multiple attack penalty against a different enemy that is within 15 feet of the first target; this Strike functions as if the target were within one range increment of you, regardless of the actual distance. The item used to make these attacks isn't destroyed or doesn't fall to the ground after you make the second attack.</p>",
