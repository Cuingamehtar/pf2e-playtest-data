You dash across the battlefield seemingly to face an enemy only to catch them by surprise with an astounding stunt that sends them reeling. All the while, adrenaline courses through your body, fueling your appetite for risk.</em></p><p><strong>Key Attribute: STRENGTH OR DEXTERITY</strong></p><p>At 1st level, your class gives you an attribute boost to your choice of Strength or Dexterity.</p><p><strong>Hit Points 8 plus your Constitution modifier</strong></p><p>You increase your maximum number of HP by this number at 1st level and every level thereafter.</p><h2>During combat encounters...</h2><p>You are constantly on the move, as the act of merely fighting isn't enough to keep your adrenaline pumping. You push yourself off walls, spin around pillars, and even ricochet between larger foes all while risking the ire of more reactive combatants. You may not hit as hard as other martial characters, but your follow-up attacks are often more reliable so you tend to hit more often.</p><h2>During social encounters...</h2><p>You might be a gregarious individual, laughing off your cuts and bruises from your latest escapade. Or you might be a brooding loner, preferring to be left alone to recuperate once the adrenaline has worn off. In either case, the scars from your stunts can make for interesting conversation pieces.</p><h2>While exploring...</h2><p>The dangers of dungeons, ruined temples, and other sites of adventure are your bread and butter, so you often lead your allies in these situations. While you try not to trigger deadly traps on purpose, you can quickly extricate yourself from such hazards.</p><h2>In downtime...</h2><p>Thanks to your ability to withstand punishment, you generally spend less time recuperating than most. In your spare time, you might earn coin by performing your death-defying acts for an audience.</p><h2>You might...</h2><ul><li>Laugh in the face of danger.</li><li>Regularly get yourself in over your head.</li><li>Enjoy showing off your collection of scars and mended broken bones.</li></ul><h2>Others probably...</h2><ul><li>Worry that you take too many risks.</li><li>Get inspired by your devil-may-care attitude.</li><li>Follow you excitedly into peril and adventure.</li></ul><h1>Initial Proficiencies</h1><p>At 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics.
