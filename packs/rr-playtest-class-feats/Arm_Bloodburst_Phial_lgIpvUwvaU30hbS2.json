      "value": "<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per 10 minutes</p><hr /><p>Your bloodburst phial is an ampoule of volatile monster blood designed to detonate when attached to a weapon, which you gain as a secondary tool. You lock your bloodburst phial into a weapon you're wielding. If that weapon is a ranged weapon, you can also Interact to reload it as you load the phial as ammunition. Your next Strike with that weapon this turn gains the splash trait and deals an additional 12d6 persistent bleed damage and 12 persistent bleed splash damage. You are immune to this splash damage. If you have a free hand, you can instead arm your bloodburst phial to treat it as an alchemical bomb, which you can Strike with once before the end of the turn to deal @Damage[12d6[persistent,bleed]] damage and 12 persistent bleed splash damage. At 17th level, the persistent bleed damage increases to @Damage[14d6[persistent,bleed]|shortLabel] in either case.</p><p><strong>Reinforced</strong> Your bloodburst phial deals an additional 1d6 damage and 1 splash damage of one of the trophy's non-physical damage types.</p>",
